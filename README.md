# peuler-lib-rust
A Rust library for solving Project Euler problems. This does not contain any solutions!

I make no maintenance promises; this library is only for my personal use.

Feel free to contact me if you feel that any of the functionality (such as factorization) is worth pulling into a dedicated library.
